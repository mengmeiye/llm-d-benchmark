## Observability

As of today, observability, via Grafana dashboards, is considered to be outside of the scope for `llm-d-benchmark`. Please refer to the [installation guide on llm-d-deployer](https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-deployer/tree/main/quickstart#grafana-dashboards) for instructions on how to enable it.

### Examples

These plots, automatically generated, were used to showcase the difference between a baseline `vLLM` deployment and `llm-d` (for models Llama 4 Scout and Lllama 3.1 70B)
