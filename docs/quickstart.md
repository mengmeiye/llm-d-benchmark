> [!WARNING]
> This quickstart guide is **not** up-to-date with the latest code!

For a simplified workflow that includes analysis of benchmark results, check out the `quickstart-existing-stack-benchmark` launcher. This workflow provides:

- Easy deployment and execution of benchmarks on Kubernetes
- Support for comparing multiple LLM models
- Generation of comprehensive performance visualizations

### Quickstart Workflows

1. **Single Model Benchmark**: Run benchmarks for a single model with automated analysis
   - See [Single Model Quickstart](quickstart-existing-stack-benchmark/README.md) for details

2. **Multi-Model Comparison**: Compare performance across multiple LLM models
   - See [Multi-Model Comparison Quickstart](quickstart-existing-stack-benchmark/Compare-README.md) for details

To get started, navigate to the `quickstart-existing-stack-benchmark` directory and follow the instructions in the respective README files.
