# llmdbenchmark.experiment

Design of Experiments (DoE) orchestrator. Manages the lifecycle of multi-treatment experiments where each setup treatment triggers a full standup, run, and teardown cycle.

## Experiment YAML Format

Experiment files define two sections:

```yaml
experiment:
  name: my-experiment      # Optional; defaults to filename
  harness: inference-perf  # Optional; overrides scenario harness
  profile: my_profile.yaml # Optional; overrides scenario profile

setup:
  constants:               # Merged into every setup treatment
    model.maxModelLen: 4096
  treatments:
    - name: tp2
      decode.parallelism.tensor: 2
    - name: tp4
      decode.parallelism.tensor: 4

treatments:                # Or "run:" -- workload treatments
  - name: low-concurrency
    load.stages.0.concurrency_level: 2
  - name: high-concurrency
    profile: random_concurrent.yaml     # Optional; selects a different source profile
    load.stages.0.concurrency_level: 16
```

### Setup Treatments

Each setup treatment provides config overrides that are deep-merged into the base scenario before plan rendering. Overrides use dotted keys (e.g. `decode.parallelism.tensor: 4`) which are converted to nested dicts via `dotted_to_nested()`. Constants from `setup.constants` are merged first, then treatment-specific values override them.

Each setup treatment triggers a complete standup to run to teardown cycle.

`description.text` works as a treatment key like any other dotted override, and takes precedence over a sweep-wide `--run-description`. Since a single `--run-description` labels every treatment identically, set it per treatment when the reports need to be told apart by label rather than by experiment ID:

```yaml
  treatments:
    - name: tp2
      decode.parallelism.tensor: 2
      description.text: "TP2 baseline"
```

### Run Treatments (Workload)

Run treatments (under `treatments` or `run`) are consumed by the run phase's profile renderer. Multiple run treatments execute against a single stood-up stack. Each treatment can optionally set `profile:` to select a different source file than the one resolved from the stack config or `--workload`, enabling a workload sweep across structurally different profiles without needing separate experiment files. Non-`name`/non-`profile` keys are dotted-path overrides applied to the rendered YAML.

### Concurrent Treatment Groups

By default every treatment runs sequentially, one after another, so each one
measures its workload in isolation. A top-level `groups:` block instead declares
which treatments run *together* against the same stack:

```yaml
max_parallel_treatments: 2      # inferred from the largest group when unset (cap 8)

groups:
  - name: baseline              # one member -> sequential, as before
    treatments:
      - name: solo
        profile: profile_a.yaml

  - name: combined              # both members run at the same time
    treatments:
      - name: first
        profile: profile_a.yaml
      - name: second
        profile: profile_b.yaml
        load.stages.0.concurrency_level: 32
```

Groups run in order; a group of one is exactly the sequential path, so an
experiment file with a flat `treatments:` list and no `groups:` behaves as it
always has. Combined with per-treatment `profile:`, a group puts several
structurally different workloads on one endpoint at once.

Each treatment keeps its own rendered profile, experiment ID, result set and pod
label (`llmdbench.ai/treatment`), so waits and result collection never cross
between concurrent members.

Notes and limits:

- **Concurrent members compete for the same stack.** Their per-treatment
  numbers reflect the combined load rather than the workload alone. This is
  logged as a warning and recorded in the benchmark report under
  `scenario.load.metadata` (`treatment`, `treatment_group`, `concurrent_with`),
  so the caveat travels with the data. Pair a group with single-member groups to
  have a baseline to compare against.
- **A group needs more harness memory than a single treatment**, since each
  member holds its own dataset. `harness.resources.memoryLimit` gives headroom
  above the `memory` request for exactly this; the default covers a small group.
  A wider one, or members replaying large traces, may need
  `--set harness.resources.memoryLimit=<N>Gi` (or `setup.constants` under the
  `experiment` subcommand -- a top-level treatment override cannot set it, since
  those apply to the rendered workload profile rather than the pod spec).
- **`reset_caches` fires once per group**, never between concurrent members: a
  reset mid-group would wipe a cache a sibling is still warming. Members of a
  multi-member group therefore do not each start cold.
- **`reset_caches_required` stops before a group, not after.** Any reset
  warning (no serving pods, a 404 with dev mode off, `success: false` after
  the retries) aborts the run before the group starts, since nothing is
  running yet. Off by default: a plain `reset_caches` run warns and continues.
  Setting it without `reset_caches` fails the run immediately. It cannot see
  through LMCache, which reports success without clearing.
- **`treatment_stop_on_error` stops at a group boundary.** The current group
  finishes first, since killing in-flight siblings would orphan pods and
  half-collect results.
- **`harness` cannot vary per treatment** -- it selects the image, entrypoint,
  profiles directory and scripts ConfigMap for the whole run. A `harness:` key
  inside a treatment is rejected.
- A malformed `groups:` block is a hard error rather than a silent fall back to
  sequential, which would report a combined run that never happened.
- Members start back-to-back but reach `Running` subject to image pull and
  scheduling, so the first seconds of the faster-starting member are
  uncontended. Over runs of minutes that is noise.

### Matrix

The total experiment matrix is `setup_treatments x run_treatments`. For example, 3 setup treatments and 4 run treatments produce 12 total runs.

### Optional Setup Section

The `setup` section is optional. When absent, the experiment file behaves identically to the existing `--experiments` run-only flow -- a single standup runs all workload treatments.

## Files

```
experiment/
├── __init__.py    -- Package docstring
├── parser.py      -- ExperimentPlan parser
└── summary.py     -- ExperimentSummary tracker
```

## ExperimentParser (`parser.py`)

### `parse_experiment(path: Path) -> ExperimentPlan`

Parse an experiment YAML file into a structured `ExperimentPlan`. Raises `FileNotFoundError` if the file does not exist and `ValueError` if the content is not a YAML mapping.

### `read_treatment_groups(path) -> list[TreatmentGroup]`

Read the top-level `groups` block. Returns `[]` when the file is
unset/missing/unreadable or carries no `groups` key, so callers fall back to one
implicit group per treatment. Unlike the other readers in this module it raises
`ValueError` on a *present but malformed* block, on a treatment named in two
groups, and on a per-treatment `harness:` key.

### `groups_from_treatments(treatments) -> list[TreatmentGroup]`

Wrap a flat treatment list as one single-member group each -- the sequential
path, used when a file has no `groups` block.

### `dotted_to_nested(flat: dict) -> dict`

Convert a flat dict with dotted keys to a nested dict. Raises `ValueError` on key conflicts (e.g. `a.b: 1` alongside `a.b.c: 2`).

```python
>>> dotted_to_nested({"a.b.c": 1, "a.b.d": 2, "x": 3})
{"a": {"b": {"c": 1, "d": 2}}, "x": 3}
```

### Key Data Types

```python
@dataclass
class SetupTreatment:
    name: str                              # Treatment identifier
    overrides: dict[str, Any]              # Nested config overrides (post-conversion)

@dataclass
class TreatmentGroup:
    name: str                              # Group identifier
    treatments: list[dict]                 # Members; >1 run concurrently

    @property
    def is_concurrent(self) -> bool:       # len(treatments) > 1

@dataclass
class ExperimentPlan:
    name: str                              # Experiment name
    harness: str | None                    # Harness override
    profile: str | None                    # Profile override
    setup_treatments: list[SetupTreatment] # Infrastructure treatments
    run_treatments_count: int              # Number of workload treatments
    experiment_file: Path                  # Source file path
    has_setup_phase: bool                  # True if setup section was present

    @property
    def total_matrix(self) -> int:         # setup_count x run_count
```

## ExperimentSummary (`summary.py`)

Tracks per-treatment outcomes across the experiment lifecycle.

### `ExperimentSummary`

```python
@dataclass
class ExperimentSummary:
    experiment_name: str
    total_setup_treatments: int
    total_run_treatments: int
    results: list[TreatmentResult]
    start_time: float

    def record_success(self, setup_treatment, run_completed, run_total, workspace_dir=None, duration=0.0): ...
    def record_failure(self, setup_treatment, phase, error, run_completed=0, run_total=0, ...): ...
    def write(self, path: Path): ...       # Write experiment-summary.yaml
    def print_table(self, logger): ...     # Print formatted summary table
    def to_dict(self) -> dict: ...         # Serialize for YAML output
```

### `TreatmentResult`

```python
@dataclass
class TreatmentResult:
    setup_treatment: str
    status: (
        str  # "pending", "success", "failed_standup", "failed_run", "failed_teardown"
    )
    run_treatments_completed: int
    run_treatments_total: int
    error_message: str | None
    workspace_dir: str | None
    duration_seconds: float
```

## Orchestration Flow

The `experiment` CLI command (defined in `interface/experiment.py`) orchestrates the lifecycle:

1. Parse the experiment YAML via `parse_experiment()`.
2. Create an `ExperimentSummary` tracker.
3. For each setup treatment:
   a. Render plans with the treatment's config overrides deep-merged into the base scenario.
   b. Execute standup (all steps).
   c. Execute run (all steps, with the experiment's run treatments).
   d. Execute teardown (all steps, unless `--skip-teardown` is set).
   e. Record success or failure in the summary.
4. Write `experiment-summary.yaml` and print the summary table.

If `--stop-on-error` is set, the experiment aborts on the first failed setup treatment. Default behavior continues to the next treatment.
