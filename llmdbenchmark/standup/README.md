# llmdbenchmark.standup

Standup phase of the benchmark lifecycle. Provisions infrastructure, creates namespaces, deploys model-serving pods, and validates deployment health.

## Step Ordering

Steps are registered in `steps/__init__.py` via `get_standup_steps()` and execute in order:

| Step | Name | Scope | Description |
|------|------|-------|-------------|
| 00 | `EnsureInfraStep` | global | Validate system dependencies (kubectl, helm, etc.) and print cluster summary banner |
| 02 | `AdminPrerequisitesStep` | global | Install cluster-level admin prerequisites (CRDs, gateways, LeaderWorkerSet, SCCs) |
| 03 | `WorkloadMonitoringStep` | global | Validate cluster resources and configure workload monitoring (PodMonitors). Installs WVA controller once per `wva.namespace` across all rendered stacks. |
| 04 | `ModelNamespaceStep` | global | Prepare the model namespace. Creates one shared model PVC (idempotent across stacks) and one download Job per stack with `modelservice.uriProtocol: pvc` (or standalone). Jobs are launched in parallel (phase 1) and waited on in turn (phase 2), so total wall time ~ slowest model. Every stack's weights live in a distinct `model.path` subdirectory on the shared PVC. |
| 05 | `FMADeployStep` | per-stack | Deploy FMA controllers |
| 05 | `StandaloneDeployStep` | per-stack | Deploy vLLM as standalone Kubernetes Deployments and Services |
| 05 | `KustomizeDeployStep` | per-stack | Replay an llm-d guide's README commands (kustomize method) |
| 05 | `NoK8sDeployStep` | per-stack | Run vLLM/EPP/Envoy as plain containers (no Kubernetes) |
| 06 | `DeploySetupStep` | per-stack | Set up Helm repos, stage the helmfile values files, and deploy gateway infrastructure for modelservice mode |
| 07 | `DeployRouterStep` | per-stack | Deploy the llm-d router (EPP + provider resources) |
| 08 | `DeployModelserviceStep` | per-stack | Deploy the model via the llm-d modelservice Helm chart |
| 09 | `DeployPrismStep` | global | Deploy the in-cluster llm-d-prism dashboard |

Note: Step 01 is intentionally absent (reserved). Smoketest and inference test run as a separate phase after standup, from the `llmdbenchmark.smoketests` module; `get_standup_steps()` no longer registers them. `step_10_smoketest.py` and `step_11_inference_test.py` are still on disk but unregistered -- only their helpers are still imported.

Harness preparation (namespace, HF secret copy, preprocess ConfigMap, workload PVC, data-access pod) moved to the run phase (run step 02) — standup ends with the model endpoint serving and no benchmark-side resources. **Breaking:** step numbers 6–9 shifted down to 5–8; update any `-s` step selections.

## Standing up without PVCs (`--no-pvc`)

On clusters where users cannot provision PersistentVolumeClaims, pass
`--no-pvc` (env: `LLMDBENCH_NO_PVC=1`):

- Model weights are fetched at runtime: `modelservice.uriProtocol` is
  forced to `hf` and standalone's model-PVC mount is disabled, with a
  warning (an explicit `--set` of the same key wins). Serving pods pull
  from HuggingFace at startup — slower cold starts, and results are
  comparable only to other hf-loading runs.
- The workload PVC and data-access pod are a run-phase concern now: `run`
  creates them on demand and `run --no-pvc` skips them. Standup's
  `--no-pvc` only covers the model PVC (above); pair the two flags for a
  fully PVC-less flow.
- Scenarios with `storage.hostPath.enabled: true` fail fast — hostPath
  creates PV/PVC objects and contradicts the flag.
- Scenario `customCommand`s should serve `$MODEL_SERVE_REF` (exported to
  every serving pod) instead of hardcoding `/model-cache/...` paths -- it
  resolves to the staged PVC path in PVC mode and the HF model ID in hf
  mode, so the same scenario works under both.
- Guide/kustomize deployments that declare their own PVCs inside guide
  manifests are out of scope for this flag.
- Note: the `plan` subcommand previews the un-switched scenario (`--no-pvc`
  overrides apply at standup render time only), so a plan preview may show
  `uriProtocol: pvc` even when the standup will force `hf`.

## Updating a live stack

To change a knob on a stack that is already up, use `llmdbenchmark update --set ...`
instead of a teardown + standup. It re-runs only the standup steps that own the
changed config, so a vLLM knob restarts the serving pods without re-downloading
weights or touching PVCs and CRDs. See
[../update/README.md](../update/README.md).

## Deployment Methods

Steps 05-08 handle mutually exclusive deployment methods:

- **FMA** (step 05) -- Deploys Fast Model Actuation controllers. For more information on FMA: https://github.com/llm-d-incubation/llm-d-fast-model-actuation
- **Standalone** (step 05) -- Deploys vLLM directly as Kubernetes Deployments and Services. OpenShift routes use the naming pattern `sa-{model_id_label}-route` to stay within the 63-character DNS label limit. Step 05 is skipped when modelservice is the active method.
- **Kustomize** (step 05) -- Replays an llm-d guide's README commands.
- **NoK8s** (step 05) -- Runs vLLM/EPP/Envoy as plain containers, with no Kubernetes.
- **Modelservice** (steps 06-08) -- Deploys via the llm-d modelservice Helm chart with gateway infrastructure and GAIE. Steps 06-08 are skipped when standalone is the active method.

The `should_skip()` method on each step checks `context.deployed_methods` to determine which path to take.

## Post-Standup Smoketests

After standup completes, smoketests run automatically as a separate phase. The smoketest phase (in `llmdbenchmark.smoketests`) has three steps:

1. **Health check** (step 00) -- Pod status, `/health`, `/v1/models`, service reachability, pod direct IP, OpenShift route.
2. **Inference test** (step 01) -- Sends a sample request via `/v1/completions` (falls back to `/v1/chat/completions`), logs the response and a demo curl command.
3. **Config validation** (step 02) -- Per-scenario validators compare live pod specs against the rendered config.

Use `--skip-smoketest` to skip the automatic post-standup smoketests. They can also be run independently via `llmdbenchmark smoketest`. See [smoketests/README.md](../smoketests/README.md) for details.

## `--monitoring` Flag

When passed, `--monitoring` enables monitoring infrastructure during standup:

- Creates PodMonitor resources for Prometheus to scrape vLLM pods
- Sets EPP (inference scheduler) log verbosity to level 4 for detailed scheduling diagnostics

This is separate from the run-phase `--monitoring` flag, which controls metrics scraping and log capture during benchmark execution.

## Pod Restarts During Standup (`--pod-restart-budget`)

Some pods come up broken and only recover once deleted -- the replacement the
controller creates is fine. By default a pod in a crash state fails the
readiness wait immediately, which fails the whole standup.

`--pod-restart-budget N` (env `LLMDBENCH_POD_RESTART_BUDGET`) lets standup
absorb that: when a pod lands in a failure state a restart may clear, it is
deleted and given another chance.

```bash
llmdbenchmark standup --spec <spec> --pod-restart-budget 3
```

The budget is a **single total for the whole standup**, shared by every pod,
every wait, and every stack -- not a per-pod allowance. Three restarts means
three pod deletions in total, whether they all hit one decode pod or one each
across three stacks.

What is and is not restarted:

| Situation | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `CrashLoopBackOff`, `Error`, `OOMKilled`, pod phase `Failed` | Deleted and retried while budget remains |
| `ImagePullBackOff`, `ErrImagePull`, `InvalidImageName`, `CreateContainerConfigError` | Fails immediately -- an identical replacement would fail identically |
| Pod with no controller to recreate it | Fails immediately -- deleting it means it never comes back |
| Pod already `Terminating` | Left alone; it is not charged twice |
| Budget exhausted | Fails with `Pod restart budget exhausted (N/N)` |

Each restart adds `--pod-restart-grace` seconds (default 300) to that wait's
deadline, because the replacement pod re-pulls its image and reloads the model
from zero.

**Diagnostics are captured before deletion** -- `describe`, current logs,
previous-container logs, and events are written to
`<workspace>/setup/logs/pod-restarts/` so a restarted pod can still be
debugged after the fact. At the end of standup, every consumed restart is
reported, so a standup that only converged after deleting pods does not read
the same as one that came up clean.

Applies to every readiness wait in standup: standalone / kustomize / FMA
deploys, the gateway, and decode / prefill / inference-pool pods. Default is
`0` -- disabled, with behavior identical to before the flag existed.

Implemented by `llmdbenchmark.utilities.podstate`; see
[its README](../utilities/podstate/README.md) to add other reactions to pod
state.

## Dry-Run Behavior

In dry-run mode:

- Step 00 still connects to the cluster and resolves metadata (needed for subsequent commands).
- Steps 02-09 log the commands they would execute without applying them. Commands wrapped in `cmd.kube()`, `cmd.helm()`, and `cmd.execute()` return dry-run `CommandResult` objects. Wait helpers (`wait_for_pods`, `wait_for_pvc`) return success immediately, so no pod is ever deleted by the restart budget in dry-run mode.

## preprocess/ Subdirectory

Contains scripts executed during standalone deployment setup:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `set_llmdbench_environment.py` | Network environment detection (IP addresses, RDMA/IB devices, GID mapping) for NIXL connectivity |
| `standalone-preprocess.py` | Serialize tensorizer files if needed; runs as a pre-deployment step |
